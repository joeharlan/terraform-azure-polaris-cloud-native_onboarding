# Brief description

Simple example for Rubrik Security Cloud Azure Cloud Native Protection onboarding.  This consumes the two modules I forked from the rubrikinc repos.

In the main.tf file it imports the modules from the local file system, so you may want to modify them for your particular situation.

Enjoy!
