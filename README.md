# Rubrik | Azure Cloud Native Protection - Onboarding Example

Simple example for Rubrik Security Cloud Azure Cloud Native Protection onboarding.  This works only with the versions of the two modules I forked from the rubrikinc repos:

Tenant: https://github.com/joeharlan/terraform-azure-polaris-cloud-native_tenant

Subscription: https://github.com/joeharlan/terraform-azure-polaris-cloud-native_subscription

In the `main.tf` file it imports the modules from the local file system, so you may want to modify them for your particular situation.
You may certainly reference the modules in GitHub if you prefer.

Enjoy!
